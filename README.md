# Crates3D

Based on the Ti83 game 'Crates 3D':
http://tiwizard.com/downloads/crates-3d/

Full TI83 version including Z80 source and level editor:
http://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/214/21464.html

Guide the black block to the other black block.

Keys: 
Direction keys = move
A = rotate view 90 degrees
B = 'push' a crate (in conjunction with direction key)
Hold-A = quit / retart a level (e.g. if a mistake made)

On the title screen you can choose which level to play
using the left and right keys, then press 'B' to begin.

(Extra levels made with the Microsoft Windows level editor should work
OK here in theory if the file format is converted)

Please see the 'crates3d_TI83.txt' file for more detaled instructions.
